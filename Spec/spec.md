A real-time conversational voice agent that conducts initial phone screening interviews with candidates, evaluates responses against job requirements, and generates structured assessment reports for human review. The agent replaces manual phone screening while maintaining fairness, consistency, and candidate experience quality.


First we need to ask the user to provide the company webiste and job title and description they looking for to screening
- extract the company information from the website and store it for LLM context

Next we need to ask the user to choose interview types
- Experience verification (technical depth)
- Behavioral/situational (STAR method)
- Role-specific knowledge (tools, frameworks, processes)
- Cultural fit (values, work style)


Based on the types we need to show some predefined questions to user allow them to edit or add new questions or use AI to generate questions etc 

Once we have the questions we need to ask the user to provide the candidates phone number and name and start the interview
